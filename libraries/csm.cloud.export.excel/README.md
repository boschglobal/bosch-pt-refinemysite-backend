# Excel Export Template

This repository provides an Excel template to export data from RefinemySite into Excel.

## How it works
Using Power Query M code, the template queries the public Timeline REST API with a Personal Access Token (PAT) generated by the user.
More details can be found in the end user tutorial.

## Build
The build pipeline bundles the Excel template and the tutorial together as a zip file.
There are separate zip files for staging (sandboxes, dev, review) and production because the Timeline API endpoints of staging environments should not appear in the production version.

## Release
The release pipeline (not defined in this repository) uploads the zip file to the storage account of the developer portal.
