# Introduction

This is a repository for the "all-embracing" IntelliJ project containing
the modules and run configurations of all backend projects.

This project has to be cloned into a directory located parallel to the 
other azure-dev-ops repositories (e.g. /home/developer/Projects).

Ensure that all backend related projects including the libraries are
cloned, to not confuse IntelliJ with missing modules.
