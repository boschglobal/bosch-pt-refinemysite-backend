Refer to link:/internal/docs/index.html[RefinemySite API Guide Overview] for general API information.

The feature toggle API in RefinemySite is an API for administrators to enable and disable features for companies and
/ or users. The API is not meant to be used by normal application users - the toggles effect the availability and
functionality of other endpoints.



== Feature
A feature can be used to not release functionality immediately to all users. A feature has a name and a status.
The name of the feature has to be clarified with the the backend developers as it has to match the implemented
name in the code to have any effect.

A feature can be in state:

* `WHITELIST_ACTIVATED`: Feature is only enabled for subjects on a whitelist (i.e. Companies, Projects, etc.) `[DEFAULT]`
* `ENABLED`: Feature is enabled globally for all users on the platform
* `DISABLED`: Feature is disabled globally for all users on the platform (whitelist is not lost)

Subjects (i.e. Companies, Projects, etc) can be added to and removed from a whitelist to enable or disable the feature.
