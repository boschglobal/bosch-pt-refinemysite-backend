[[relations]]
== Relations

Relations allow to express that two resources (tasks or milestones) are related in a certain way.
This could be a predecessor/successor dependency (`FINISH_TO_START`), or a subtask relation between a task and a milestone (`PART_OF`).

A relation is directed.
The resource on the left side is called `source`, the resource on the right side is called `target`.

Supported relation types:

* The `FINISH_TO_START` relation is a dependency well known in project management.
It means that the `source` must be finished before work on the `target` can start.
Therefore, the `source` is a predecessor of the `target`, and the `target` is a successor of the source.
This relation can be created between any combination of tasks and milestones:
** task ->  task
** task -> milestone
** milestone -> milestone
** milestone -> task.
* The `PART_OF` relation can be used to establish a subtask relation between a task and a milestone.
The `source` must be a task, and the `target` must be a milestone.
Other combinations of tasks and milestones are not allowed.
Therefore, the only valid combination is:
** task -> milestone



[[create-relation]]
=== Create relation

Creates a relation of the specified `type` between a `source` and a `target`.

[[create-relation-latest]]
==== Latest API Version

[[create-relation-request-latest]]
===== Request

A new relation is created with a `POST` request.

The combination of relation `type`, `source` and `target` must be unique to avoid the creation of duplicates.

====== Request fields

include::{snippets}/relations/document-create-relation/request-fields.adoc[]

====== Example request

include::{snippets}/relations/document-create-relation/http-request.adoc[]

[[create-relation-response-latest]]
===== Response

Returns `201 Created` if the relation was created successfully.
The created relation is returned as response body.

Returns `400 Bad Request` if the client tried to create a duplicate relation, or if the request was malformed.

[[search-relations]]
=== Search relations

Search relations that satisfy given criteria.

[[search-relations-latest]]
==== Latest API Version

[[search-relations-request-latest]]
===== Request

Use a `POST` request to get a page of relations.
You can specify a set of (optional) filter criteria to only retrieve a subset of relations.

A relation `r` will match the given filter criteria if:

* the type of `r` is included in `types` (or if `types` is empty)
* *and* if
** the source of `r` is included in `sources`, *or*
** the target of `r` is included in  `targets`.

If both `sources` and `targets` are empty, all relations of the specified type will be returned.
