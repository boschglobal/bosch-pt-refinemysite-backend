== Project Calendar

Project data from the calendar can be exported in various formats.
The calendar can be exported as a PDF (which is more or less the same graphical representation as shown in the Web UI), as JSON or CVS.
JSON and CSV export contain task and day card information represented in a flat structure.
Those exports are still BETA.

The endpoints trigger the export which is executed asynchronously as a job.
The status of the export job can be retrieved from the jobs endpoint.
The resulting file is available as part of the job resource once it is completed.
