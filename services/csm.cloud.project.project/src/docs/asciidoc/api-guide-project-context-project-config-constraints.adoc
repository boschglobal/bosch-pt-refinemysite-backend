== Task Constraints (Configuration)
The following endpoints can be used to configure reasons (constraints) that can be selected by users to indicate
that necessary preconditions of tasks have not been met in order to start them on time.
There are 8 default constraints and 4 customizable ones. The default constraints are activated by default,
can be deactivated and re-activated.
The 4 customizable constraints can be renamed, activated, deactivated and reactivated.
At least one constraint must be active.
