[[project-participants]]
== Project Participants



[[assign-project-participant]]
=== Add participant
This endpoint is used to add a user as a participant to a project. The user to be added is identified by the email
address.

In case the user is not registered yet, the user is invited and receives an email to signup. The participant is added
in status "INVITED". When the user signs up, the status is automatically changed to "VALIDATION". Once the user is
assigned as an employee to a company, the status changed to "ACTIVE".

In case the user is already registered and assigned to a company, it is directly added as an active participant.
If the user is registered, and not yet assigned to a company, the user is added as a participant in status
"VALIDATION".

This operation is only permitted to CSMs of the project.

Invitations are valid for a timespan of 30 days. After 30 days, pending invitations and therewith invited
participants are automatically removed.
