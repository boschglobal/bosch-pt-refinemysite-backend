[[import-project]]
=== Import project
This endpoint can be used to import a project either from a Microsoft Project (.mpp) file
or an Oracle Primavera P6 (.xer) file.

The import consists of three steps:

* upload
* analyze
* import

The steps with their corresponding endpoints are described below.

[[import-project-upload]]
==== Upload file to import
This endpoint can be used to upload the file to import.
Imports can only be applied to empty projects (a project without crafts, working areas, tasks, topics, etc.)
The uploaded file is validated and a list of column names, extracted from the file is returned to the caller.
The column names can be used in the analysis step to configure how the data should be interpreted in the
import process.

[[import-project-upload-latest]]
===== Latest API Version

[[import-project-upload-request-latest]]
====== Request
A `POST` / `Multipart-File-Upload` request is used to upload the file to import.

====== Path parameters
include::{snippets}/project-import/document-project-import-upload/path-parameters.adoc[]

====== Example request
include::{snippets}/project-import/document-project-import-upload/curl-request.adoc[]

[[import-project-upload-response-latest]]
====== Response
The upload response with the columns is returned.

====== Response fields

====== Example response
include::{snippets}/project-import/document-project-import-upload/http-response.adoc[]


[[import-project-analyze]]
==== Analyze file to import
This endpoint can be used to analyze the file to import.
The import process can be customized by specifying the additional parameters how the data in the file should
be interpreted. The previously returned column names can be used to specify e.g. the column from where the
working area and craft/discipline names should be extracted.
The endpoint analyzes the file using the supplied optional parameters and returns a list of elements that are
either auto-corrected or cannot be imported.
If there are no errors detected that prevent an import, then a `import` link is in the response, emphasising
that the import can be started.
