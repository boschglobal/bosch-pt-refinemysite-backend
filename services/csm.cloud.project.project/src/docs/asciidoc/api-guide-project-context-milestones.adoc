[[milestones]]
== Milestones
Milestones represent a major target in a construction project. They can be defined on different levels being
PROJECT, INVESTOR or CRAFT. Project milestones represent targets for the entire construction project across
all crafts. Investor milestones are similar but defined from the perspective of the investor and relevant for
them (could be for financial / contractual purposes). Craft milestone, as the name says, are relevant for a
specific craft involved in the project.


[[create-milestone]]
=== Create milestones
This endpoint can be used to create a milestone. Craft milestones require a craft to be referenced. Other milestone
types are not using the craft reference. If a milestone is a header milestone, the work area reference is not used.
