Refer to link:/internal/docs/index.html[RefinemySite API Guide Overview] for general API information.

== PATs

PATs are Personal Access Tokens.
They can be used to authenticate and authorize as a user (impersonatedUser) with the public API.

[[list-pat]]
=== List all PATs

In order to retrieve a list of the current user's PATs, a `GET` on the PAT resource can be performed.

[[list-pat-latest]]
==== Latest API version

[[list-pat-request-latest]]
===== Request

A `GET` request is used to retrieve the list of the current user's PATs.

====== Example request

include::{snippets}/pat/document-list-pat/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/pat/document-list-pat/curl-request.adoc[]

[[list-pat-response-latest]]
===== Response

The list of PATs is returned.

====== Response fields

====== Example response

[[create-pat]]
=== Create a PAT

Used to create a new Personal Access Token (PAT).
A PAT can be created for one or more than one scope.
Currently, Personal Access Tokens can be used to access the two branches of the public API only:
_GRAPHQL_API_READ_ grants read access to the GraphQL API,
_TIMELINE_API_READ_ grants read access to the Timeline API.

[[create-pat-latest]]
==== Latest API version

[[create-pat-request-latest]]
===== Request

A `POST` request is used to create a new PAT.

====== Request fields

include::{snippets}/pat/document-create-pat/request-fields.adoc[]

====== Example request

include::{snippets}/pat/document-create-pat/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/pat/document-create-pat/curl-request.adoc[]

[[create-pat-response-latest]]
===== Response

The created PAT is returned.
It includes the secret token value which cannot be retrieved later (as it will not be stored in the system).
The token value is composed as follows:
{type}.{identifier}.{secret-value}

- The type indicates how the token is composed i.e. which hashing algorithm is used.
- The identifier of the token allows to retrieve the token's stored data (hashed value, scopes).
- The secret value is the actual secret. For _RMSPAT1_-type tokens it is a 32-character random string
of characters and digits as well as a few selected special characters.

For _RMSPAT1_-type tokens the hashed value is derived using BCrypt algorithm (Spring standard).
Verification can be done like so:
```
org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCrypt.checkpw("{secret-value}", "{hashed-value}")
```
