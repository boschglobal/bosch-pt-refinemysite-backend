Refer to link:/internal/docs/index.html[RefinemySite API Guide Overview] for general API information.

A user in RefinemySite represents a person, who signed-up to work with RefinemySite.
Since we are using Bosch CIAM for authentication, a user (in the sense of a person) first logs in at the Bosch CIAM server to get a valid OAuth2 token.
This token is then used for further sign-up at RefinemySite.
As long as the user has not signed-up with a valid token for RefinemySite, he cannot use RefinemySite.
Therefore, all requests to our API will fail with a 403.

We distinguish between the regular representation of the user resource and the current user representation.
The latter one is used for the currently logged-in Ãºser and restricts access to the general one is used by administration users.



== Current User
The current user endpoint is used to interact with the user in RefinemySite that corresponds to the user identified by the OAuth2 token retrieved from the Bosch CIAM server.
It provides endpoints for sign-up / registration, for updates and to retrieve the current user.
