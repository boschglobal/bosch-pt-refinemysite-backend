== Task News

Smartsite keeps track of events that are changing a task or a nested object (like a topic, a comment for a topic,
various attachments etc.) and it provides user-specific information if something is "new" (meaning something has
changed) on a task (or a nested object of the task). So whenever a user changes something on an object like a task, a
topic, a message etc. this is recorded as news for all other users that have access to this object.

The task news resource provides this information for the current user (user information is taken from the access
token).

[[resources-search-task-news]]
=== Search for task news

To get news for a list of tasks (to enrich a task list with news markers, for example) a search endpoint is provided
that can be accessed with a `POST` method call and that accepts a list of task identifiers. The result will contain all
existing news for the requested tasks but not for nested objects like topics, messages etc.

==== Request

A `POST` request is used to search for news for a list of given tasks.
