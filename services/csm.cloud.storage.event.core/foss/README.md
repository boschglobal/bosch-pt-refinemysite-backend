# FOSS Documentation

## Concept

This folder contains the license report required for FOSS compliance.
The report consists of

- all licenses listed in report/licenses.csv
- all license texts (originals) downloaded in report/licenses folder

## Updating FOSS Report

The report can be generated by executing `update-report.sh` locally.
The script outputs a list of licenses used and updates the artifacts in
the report folder. Changes can be evaluated in git diff.

If needed, run `install-license-tool.sh` for the above script to work.

## Automated verification of report integrity (up-to-date)

To ensure the report is up-to-date, a pipeline task will call
`verify-report-integrity.sh` and fail if the current licenses used
differs from the report checked in. Please refer to _Updating FOSS Report_
when that happens.
