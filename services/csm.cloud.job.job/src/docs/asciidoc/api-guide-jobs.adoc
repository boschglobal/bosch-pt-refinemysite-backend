Refer to link:/internal/docs/index.html[RefinemySite API Guide Overview] for general API information.

== Jobs
A Job is triggered by a User and is executed asynchronously in the backend.  It represents the state of the execution and its results.  Independent of the state, a Job is deleted when it remains unchanged for several days.

The Job API enables browsing and updating Jobs of an authenticated User.


=== List All Jobs

Sending a `GET` request to the Job list resource will return all Jobs of the current user.  The list is paged and can be sorted by `lastModifiedDate` (default) and `status`.

.Example Request
include::{snippets}/jobs/list/http-request.adoc[]

.Example Response Body
include::{snippets}/jobs/list/response-body.adoc[]

.Response Fields
include::{snippets}/jobs/list/response-fields.adoc[]


=== Update Job List Last-Seen Timestamp

This sets the `lastSeen` timestamp of the list of Jobs for the current User.  The timestamp is used to determine whether the list was updated while the User was not looking at it.

To update the timestamp, `POST` it to the Job list resource.

.Example Request
include::{snippets}/jobs/update-last-seen/http-request.adoc[]

.Request Body Fields
include::{snippets}/jobs/update-last-seen/request-fields.adoc[]

The response is HTTP status `202 - ACCEPTED` with no body. The timestamp of the list resource is updated to match the one in the request body.


=== Mark Job Result as Read

Updates the `read` flag of a single Job.  This is used to signal to a User that they already looked at or downloaded the result of this Job.

To update, `POST` an empty request to the Job resource.

.Request Path Parameters
include::{snippets}/jobs/mark-as-read/path-parameters.adoc[]

.Example Request
include::{snippets}/jobs/mark-as-read/http-request.adoc[]

The response is HTTP status `202 - ACCEPTED` with no body.  The `read` flag of the Job is set to `true`.
