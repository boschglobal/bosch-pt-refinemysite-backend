== Notifications

RefinemySite keeps track of events that are changing an object (e.g project, task, topic, etc.) and it provides
user-specific notifications if something is "new" and relevant for the user (e.g. CSM is informed about day card status
changes).

Beside a proactive live-update message that is sent for a notification when a user is currently connected, the
notifications are stored and can be retrieved via REST (for a limited time).

Notifications can be loaded, and marked as seen (global and on message level).



[[get-notifications]]
=== Get notifications

[[get-notifications-latest]]
==== Latest API version

[[get-notifications-request-latest]]
===== Request

A `GET` request is used to find notifications for the current user. If nothing is specified, you get the 50 most recent
notifications. If you specify a date using the "after" or "before" query parameter, the next chunk is loaded from
that date on, either older ones (parameter "before") or newer ones (parameter "after").
